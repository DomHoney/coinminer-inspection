    Thread-safe connection pool for one host.

    :param host:
        Host used for this HTTP Connection (e.g. "localhost"), passed into
        :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

    :param port:
        Port used for this HTTP Connection (None is equivalent to 80), passed
        into :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

    :param strict:
        Causes BadStatusLine to be raised if the status line can't be parsed
        as a valid HTTP/1.0 or 1.1 status line, passed into
        :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

        .. note::
           Only works in Python 2. This parameter is ignored in Python 3.

    :param timeout:
        Socket timeout in seconds for each individual connection. This can
        be a float or integer, which sets the timeout for the HTTP request,
        or an instance of :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout` which gives you more
        fine-grained control over request timeouts. After the constructor has
        been parsed, this is always a `urllib3.util.Timeout` object.

    :param maxsize:
        Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful
        in multithreaded situations. If ``block`` is set to False, more
        connections will be created but they will not be saved once they've
        been used.

    :param block:
        If set to True, no more than ``maxsize`` connections will be used at
        a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block
        until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for
        particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more
        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param retries:
        Retry configuration to use by default with requests in this pool.

    :param _proxy:
        Parsed proxy URL, should not be used directly, instead, see
        :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ProxyManager`"

    :param _proxy_headers:
        A dictionary with proxy headers, should not be used directly,
        instead, see :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ProxyManager`"

    :param \\**conn_kw:
        Additional parameters are used to create fresh :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection`,
